# RecursiveFractalTree-JS-p5
â€‹In an attempt to learn about fractals, I created a recursive fractal tree. Inspired by a coding challenge by "The Coding Tree", a YouTube channel by Daniel Shiffman, the project uses p5.js

Play around with the parameters or switch on the stochastic mode to let it create some random trees by itself.
